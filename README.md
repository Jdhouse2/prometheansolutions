## To Run The Code:
1. Make sure you have Node installed! Here's a basic guide: https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows. Make sure you can run `node -v` in the command prompt and get a version out - if you don't then something went wrong :( 

2. Navigate into this repo locally within the command window! Make sure you have the latest master pulled (git pull origin master)

3. In your command window run `npm install`. This will download project dependencies - no worries if that raises questions. All that matters is that they get pulled down using that command! :) 

4. Again in your command window, run `node index.js`. In your console, you should get a message saying `Example app listening on port 8000!`. 

5. Open your browser and go to `localhost:8080`. The webpage should be there!

## How to contribute
1. Nothing fancy here! Basically just pointing out that if you make changes to the index.js folder, they will only be reflected after stopping the server (`ctrl + c` inside your terminal) and restarting it (`node index.js`). HTML / CSS changes should only need a browser refresh.
